## 📂 Repository Structure  
This repository is organized into the following sections:  

- **`course_materials/`** 📖 – Includes Google Colab notebooks for teaching subjects like Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Geometry.  
- **`research/`** 🔬 – Mathematical explorations, theoretical research, and applications to AI and finance.  
- **`blogs/`** ✍ – Personal thoughts, academic reflections, and teaching methodologies.  
- **`ideas/`** 💡 – Brainstorming notes and exploratory concepts.  

## 🔄 Branching Strategy

Currently, my **GitBook documents** are stored privately. Select sections may be released publicly in the future. I’m currently using the following two GitBooks, which I’ve authored, as part of my teaching materials. Here are the links:
-  [Matematica I](https://jaruiz.gitbook.io/matematica-i)
-  [Matemática II](https//jaruiz.gitbook.io/matematica-ii)
